***TIC TAC TOE AI SPEC***


Welcome to the tic tac toe ai spec!

first: head [here to get the solution to tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/appacademy/solutions/raw/master/w1/w1d2/06_tic_tac_toe.rb). 

Place this file into the lib folder. This is needed to start your 
  `TicTacToeNode` class because it depends upon 
  a working instance of the TicTacToe game.

Create a file. I called mine `02_ttt_ai.rb`. It seemed like a good name. In
both of the spec files require your `02_ttt_ai.rb` file, whatever you call it.

In this file create the `TicTacToeNode` and `SuperComputerPlayer` classes as per
the instructions.

Now make those tests go green!
